# palindrome-checker-python
Palindrome Checker is a Python program that checks if a string reads the same forwards and backwards. It handles multi-line inputs, ignores non-alphanumeric characters, and is case-insensitive. Users can continuously test strings and receive formatted feedback on whether each string is a palindrome.
